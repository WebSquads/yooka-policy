  <h1>Yooka – Community & Safety Standards</h1>

  <p><strong>Age Restriction:</strong><br>
  Yooka is strictly for users aged 18 years and above. Access is not allowed for minors. Users must confirm their age during registration.</p>

  <p><strong>Chat and Voice:</strong><br>
  Yooka allows users to communicate via in-app text chat and real-time voice chat in public or private rooms. No audio chat is stored on our servers. We prioritize real-time interaction only.</p>

  <p><strong>Safety and Moderation:</strong><br>
  Users must not engage in harassment, nudity, hate speech, bullying, or any form of illegal activity. Such behavior is strictly prohibited and may lead to immediate ban or suspension.</p>

  <p><strong>Reporting and Blocking:</strong><br>
  Users can block or report others directly from within the app. Reported behavior is reviewed promptly by our moderation team.</p>

  <p><strong>User Verification:</strong><br>
  We use manual and automated measures to discourage underage users and fake accounts, and monitor behavior patterns to detect policy violations.</p>

  <p><strong>Privacy:</strong><br>
  We do not store user voice chat. Usernames, profile pictures, and other basic info are stored securely on our servers and never shared with third parties without user consent.</p>
